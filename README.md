# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

Front-End Party is dedicated to being inclusive to the largest number of people, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we strive to provide a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in Front-End Party to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members, participants, and attendees:

- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt cooperation before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Harassment is unacceptable within our community, including all participants and attendees. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion

- Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.

## Weapons Policy

No weapons will be allowed at Front-End Party events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If any community member, participant, or attendee engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community and/or event without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## Reporting 

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, feel unsafe or unwelcome, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible by either directly contacting the organizers or filing an anonymous report:
